	  <p class="center" id="MainText">The Minotaur is a beast who is part man and part bull (usually depicted as a man with a bull's head). <br>
	  He lived inside the Labyrinth created by Daedalus. He was imprisoned there  due to his savage nature and<br> thirst for human flesh. <br>
	  The Minotaur was finally killed by <a id="TheseusLink" href="Theseus.html">Theseus</a> when he was sent into the Labyrinth as a sacrafice.
