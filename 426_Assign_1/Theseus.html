	  <p class="center" id="LTitle">Theseus is known for <strong>two</strong> main reasons:</p>
	    <ol class="center"> 
	    <li>Being the demigod son of <a href="Poseidon.html">Poseidon</a></li>
	    <li>Slaying the <a href="Minotaur.html">Minotaur</a> while imprisoned in the Labyrinth</li>
	    </ol>
	  <p class="center" id="MainText">Technically, Theseus had three parents. His mother is the mortal woman Aethra, and he has two fathers,<br>
	     a mortal father Aegeus, who was king of Athens, and a divine father, Poseidon, god of the seas.<br>
	  </p>
	  <div>
	    <p class="center">He rose to glory when he volunteered to be an Athenian sacrafice to the Minotaur, <br>
		whom he killed in the center of the Labyrinth. This myth is also where English gets the word clue, as the way that <br>
		Theseus found his way out of the Labyrinth was by laying out a line of string that he could follow back to the exit, <br>
		and in Greek, the word for a spool of string is "clew".
